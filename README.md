Here's a `README.md` file for your GitHub repository that explains the AWS cost optimization solution:

# AWS Cost Optimization 

![AWS Cost Optimization](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-Cost_Optimization-orange?logo=amazon-aws) 
![Terraform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Terraform-Infrastructure_as_Code-blue?logo=terraform)

A Terraform-based solution to monitor, alert, and optimize AWS cloud costs with automated governance controls.

##  Solution Overview

This repository implements a complete AWS-native cost optimization framework addressing four key challenges:

1. **Real-time cost visibility** with daily CUR reports and budgets
2. **Smart anomaly detection** with AI-based alerts
3. **Automated optimization** of compute resources
4. **Governance enforcement** through SCPs and tagging policies

##  Key Features

‚úÖ **Cost Visibility**
- Daily Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) to S3
- AWS Budgets with email/Slack notifications
- QuickSight dashboards for cost analysis

 **Smart Alerting**
- AI-based cost anomaly detection
- Multi-channel alerts (Email/Slack/SMS)
- Threshold-based CloudWatch alarms

 **Automated Optimization**
- Right-sizing recommendations via Compute Optimizer
- Scheduled scaling for non-production resources
- Idle resource identification with Trusted Advisor

 **Governance Controls**
- Mandatory tagging enforcement via SCPs
- AWS Config for compliance monitoring
- Resource grouping by project/environment

##  Storage Cleanup
- Automated Lambda for orphaned EBS volume cleanup
- lambda automation for orphaned ebs termination
- Removing deployment not in use 

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan changes
terraform plan

# Apply configuration
terraform apply
```

##  Expected Outcomes

- 30-50% reduction in wasted cloud spend
- Near real-time cost anomaly detection
- Automated prevention of untagged resources
- Continuous optimization of compute resources
