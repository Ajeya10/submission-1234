# AWS Cost Optimization for Atlan

![AWS Cost Optimization](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-Cost_Optimization-orange?logo=amazon-aws) 
![Terraform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Terraform-Infrastructure_as_Code-blue?logo=terraform)

A Terraform-based solution to monitor, alert, and optimize AWS cloud costs with automated governance controls.

## 🚀 Solution Overview

This repository implements a complete AWS-native cost optimization framework addressing four key challenges:

1. **Real-time cost visibility** with daily CUR reports and budgets
2. **Smart anomaly detection** with AI-based alerts
3. **Automated optimization** of compute resources
4. **Governance enforcement** through SCPs and tagging policies

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Cost Visibility**
- Daily Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) to S3
- AWS Budgets with email/Slack notifications
- QuickSight dashboards for cost analysis

🔔 **Smart Alerting**
- AI-based cost anomaly detection
- Multi-channel alerts (Email/Slack/SMS)
- Threshold-based CloudWatch alarms

⚡ **Automated Optimization**
- Right-sizing recommendations via Compute Optimizer
- Scheduled scaling for non-production resources
- Idle resource identification with Trusted Advisor

🛡️ **Governance Controls**
- Mandatory tagging enforcement via SCPs
- AWS Config for compliance monitoring
- Resource grouping by project/environment

## 🛠️ Implementation

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan changes
terraform plan

# Apply configuration
terraform apply
```

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

- 30-50% reduction in wasted cloud spend
- Near real-time cost anomaly detection
- Automated prevention of untagged resources
- Continuous optimization of compute resources

## Message to Include When Creating the Repo:

"Here's our Terraform-based AWS cost optimization framework designed specifically for Atlan's cloud cost challenges. This solution provides:

1. **Immediate cost visibility** through automated CUR reports and budgets
2. **Proactive alerting** when spending deviates from patterns
3. **Continuous optimization** without manual intervention
4. **Governance guardrails** to prevent future cost spikes

The modular Terraform code allows phased implementation:
- Start with governance and cost tracking
- Add alerting mechanisms
- Gradually implement optimization controls

Each directory contains standalone Terraform configurations that can be deployed independently while working together as a complete system."

Would you like me to suggest any additional documentation or include specific setup instructions for Atlan's environment?
